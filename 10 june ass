1.It will be a mistake to think that he was given only ‘bouquets’, he also received many ‘brickbats’.
The Christian missionaries took alarm at his popularity. They used to raise funds by preaching that India was a land of
heathens waiting to be saved by Christianity. The American press now began to say that it was a shame that anybody should try
to teach India religion, rather the world should sit at her feet to learn it. Vivekananda also said that India did not need
religion but material support. The missionaries found that the subscriptions they had so long been receiving from the people
were steadily declining. They blamed it on Swamiji. They now started denigrating him in all manner of ways. They even began 
to spread scandals against his personal character. Strangely enough, even some of his own countrymen joined them in this for
reasons of their own. But ‘Truth alone prevails’, as Swami always preached. He did not try to defend himself, but others stood 
up for him and vehemently protested. Finally, all such mean attempts failed and his reputation only rose higher and higher.
